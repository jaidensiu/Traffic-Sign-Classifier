# Traffic Sign Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network

## Description
As research continues in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), one of the key challenges is computer vision, which allows AVs to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more. For this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify road signs correctly based on a dataset of road sign images. To do so, I used a labeled dataset of images catagorized by their type, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, that contains thousand of images of 43 different kinds of road signs. The constructed model has an accuracy of 0.9901 on the test data with a cross-entropy loss of 0.0384 (model.h5).
