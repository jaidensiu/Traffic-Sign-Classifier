# Traffic Sign Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction
As research continues in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more. This project focuses on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify road signs correctly based on a dataset of road sign images. To do so, we will be using a labeled dataset of images catagorized by their type, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, that contains thousand of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.
