# Traffic Sign Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network

## Description
As research continues in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), one of the key challenges is computer vision, which allows AVs to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more. This project focuses on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify road signs correctly based on a dataset of road sign images. To do so, we will be using a labeled dataset of images catagorized by their type, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, that contains thousand of images of 43 different kinds of road signs. The constructed model has an accuracy of 0.9909 on the test data with a loss of 0.0366 (model1.h5).
